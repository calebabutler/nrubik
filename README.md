An N-Curses Based, Virtual Rubik's Cube

NRubik is a simple n-curses based virtual Rubik's cube.

# What does it look like?

Something like this:

# How do I install it?

Download the "nrubik" python script and run it with a curses supported python2 or python3 interpreter.

# Why is orange magenta?

On 8 color terminals, there is no orange but there is magenta. If you're confused why it's labeled orange in the first place, on an ordinary Rubik's Cube that is where orange would be.

# There are so many features missing. Why?

I purposely kept this program simple (the cube cannot rotate, there are no slice turns, etc.) so that any terminal geek could try it without too much trouble.

This repository is now archived. I made this code base when I was young, inexperienced and in high school, so the (in my opinion) ugly code base is not representative of how I write code today.
